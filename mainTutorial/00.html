    <h1>0. The Environment</h1>
    <p>    For this tutorial I'll be assuming anyone following along is using Visual Studio. Visual Studio Community is free
    <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">(download here)</a>, good, and perhaps
    most importantly it's what I've always used, so as someone who is resistant to change it's what we'll
    be using. Technically speaking it probably doesn't really matter what IDE or lack of IDE you use, but
    SadConsole and any other libraries I'm likely to use in this tutorial are all in the NuGet Package
    Manager in Visual Studio. </p> 
    <h1>1. The Project</h1> 
    <ul>
        <li>Open up Visual Studio, click the big button that says "Create a new project". </li>
        <li>For the template, choose Console App. Make sure you choose the C# version, not VB or C or anything else.</li>
        <li>Click next, unless you clicked next in the last step, in which case hold your horses.</li>
        <li>Pick a project name. I'll be using SadTutorial, but you can call yours whatever you like.</li>
        <li>Choose a location. I like to put mine on the desktop in a project folder, but you do you.</li>
        <li>Tick the box that says "place solution and project in same directory", then click Next. </li>
        <li>For the framework choose .NET 6.0, then click Next/Create/Whatever the button is, I clicked forward before writing this.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>    You should, at this point, see a file tab called Program.cs with a "hello world" line in it. Run this if you like and you'll get a little
    pop-up console that says "Hello, World!". If this is the case, proceed to the next section. </p> 
    <h1>2. SadConsole</h1> 
    <ul>
        <li>In the top bar click Tools, go to NuGet Packet Manager, and then click Manage NuGet Packages.</li>
        <li>Change the tab to "Browse" and look up SadConsole.</li>
        <li>Find SadConsole.Host.Monogame. Click it, then on the right tick the box and click Install. </li>
        <li>The readme.txt for SadConsole should appear, giving a basic outline for our first file. We'll be starting with something a little different, copy below.</li>
        <li>Right-click your PROJECT (below "Solution '(Project Name)') and click Properties. </li>
        <li>In the Application -> General tab, at the very top is an Output type dropdown. Change it to Windows Application.</li>
        <li>Right click Program.cs in your solution explorer and click Rename. Rename it to GameLoop.cs, click Yes on the prompt.</li>
        <li>Create a new folder in your project (right-click, Add, New Folder) named "fonts" (without the quotes).</li>
        <li>Download this and extract it into the fonts folder: <a href="../resources/fonts.zip">fonts.zip</a></li>
        <li>In Visual Studio, click the three pages icon in the solutin explorer (Show All Files)</li>
        <li>If the four font files aren't already included, select all of them and right click then click "Include in Project"</li>
        <li>With the four files still selected, in the properties section change "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy Always"</li>
    </ul> 

    <h1>3. GameLoop.cs</h1>
    <div class="code_block">
        using SadConsole; 
        using SadRogue.Primitives;
        using Console = SadConsole.Console;

        namespace SadTutorial {
            class GameLoop { 
                public const int GameWidth = 160;
                public const int GameHeight = 50;
                public const int MapWidth = 70;
                public const int MapHeight = 43;

                public static SadFont SquareFont;

                public static Console startingConsole;

                static void Main(string[] args) {
                    // Setup the engine and create the main window. 
                    Game.Create(GameWidth, GameHeight, "./fonts/ThinExtended.font");

                    // Hook the start event so we can add consoles to the system.
                    Game.Instance.OnStart = Init;

                    // Start the game.
                    Game.Instance.Run();
                    Game.Instance.Dispose();
                }

                private static void Init() {
                    // Load up our square font (CheepicusExtended) and save it for later - our game map will use it, while the rest defaults to our thin font.
                    SquareFont = (SadFont)GameHost.Instance.LoadFont("./fonts/CheepicusExtended.font");

                    // Any startup code for your game. We will use an example console for now
                    startingConsole = (Console) GameHost.Instance.Screen; 
                    startingConsole.Print(6, 5, "Hello World", Color.White);

                    // Set the window title to whatever you like, probably the name of your project.
                    Game.Instance.MonoGameInstance.Window.Title = "SadTutorial";
                }
            }
        } 
    </div> 
    <h1>4. Conclusion</h1>
    <p>    Whoa, that's a lot of code (relatively speaking, compared to the none before)! Let's break down what's going on here.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We include our libraries (SadConsole and SadRogue.Primitives) with <b>using</b></li>
        <li>We alias Console to always mean SadConsole.Console for convenience.</li>
        <li>Namespace is our project name - for me, that means SadTutorial.</li>
        <li>We initialize four variables. The actual window width and height are GameWidth and GameHeight, our play field will use MapHeight and MapWidth soon.</li>
        <li>We also declare a placeholder for our Square font (CheepicusExtended), used for the map later, and a Console for us to draw on.</li>
        <li>Our Main method is fairly boilerplate. We create the Game instance, using our GameWidth and GameHeight plus the path to our ThinExtended font. The other three lines are critical but not important to explain, just make sure you've got them.</li>
        <li>Our Init is where we differ from the basic SadConsole readme most heavily. We load a second font, and use our class-level Console variable, then print something to it.</li>
        <li>Finally we set the title of the window to be whatever we want - but generally the name of your project/game.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>    With all those steps done you should be able to run the project and see (using our thin font) the words "Hello World" on an otherwise black screen.
    That's where we'll leave this entry in the tutorial, next chapter we'll start working on actual (basic) mechanics. Also just to anticipate a possible question
    before actually getting any Frequently Asked Questions, we're using two separate fonts because space often ends up being in short supply as we work on the interface.
    The thin font lets us better utilize our horizontal space when we only need to be displaying words and numbers.</p>
