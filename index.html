    <h1>Foreword and Forewarned</h1>
    <p>I'm just going to apologize here real quick for the fact that this tutorial will 
        almost certainly look absolutely horrible. Graphic design has never been my thing,
        which is why I use SadConsole. I've been using SadConsole for a few years now, and I wouldn't say
        I'm an expert by any means, but I've been around the block a few times (then forgot, then around
        the block a few more times retreading ground). At least as of the time of writing this I'm in the
        SadConsole discord server, where I see a lot of frequently recurring questions or desire for tutorials
        from new people who join. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The other warning I want to issue before we get into things is that my code is often unconventional,
        inefficient, and frequently not the way you should be doing things. I'll try to explain why I choose
        to do things the way I do them, but my sole goal is code that does what I need it to do in the moment
        that I write it. I may (and often do) later go back and realize I missed something obvious, and fix or
        optimize it then. If you have issues while following this tutorial you may be able to get help in the
        discord, just know that the first reaction before you get help will probably be "why on earth did you do it like that".
    </p>
