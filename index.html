    <h1>Foreword and Forewarned</h1>
    <p>    I'm just going to apologize here real quick for the fact that this "website" will almost certainly
    look absolutely horrible. Graphic design has never been my thing, which is why I use SadConsole. I've been
    using SadConsole for a few years now, and I wouldn't say I'm an expert by any means, but I've been around 
    the block a few times (then forgot, then around the block a few more times retreading ground). At least 
    as of the time of writing this I'm in the SadConsole discord server, where I see a lot of frequently 
    recurring questions or desire for tutorials from new people who join. </p> 
    <p>    The second warning is that this isn't <em>really</em> a tutorial for people completely new to programming, 
    and hopefully you're coming in here with a decent grasp of programming as a whole and ideally at least a basic 
    grasp on C#, which is of course what we'll be using. I'll try to explain a lot of things as we go, and we'll do 
    things incrementally, but this is not the tutorial for you if you can't write some basic programs already.</p>
    <p>    The final warning I want to issue before we get into things is that my code is often unconventional,
    inefficient, and frequently not the way you should be doing things. I'll try to explain why I choose
    to do things the way I do them, but my sole goal is code that does what I need it to do in the moment
    that I write it. I may (and often do) later go back and realize I missed something obvious, and fix or
    optimize it then. If you have issues while following this tutorial you may be able to get help in the
    discord, just know that the first reaction before you get help will probably be "why on earth did you do it like that".
    </p>
